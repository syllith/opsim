ONE PIECE CARD GAME Comprehensive Rules

Contents of Comprehensive Rules
1. Game Overview
1-1. Number of Players
1-1-1. Fundamentally, this game is intended to be played by two players, head-to-head.
These rules do not currently support play by three or more players.
1-2. Ending the Game
1-2-1. The game ends when either player loses the game. When a player’s opponent loses
the game, the player who has not lost wins the game.
1-2-1-1. The two defeat conditions are as follows:
1-2-1-1-1. When you have 0 Life cards and your Leader takes damage.
1-2-1-1-2. When you have 0 cards in your deck.
1-2-2. When either player meets a defeat condition, they will lose the game according to
the rule processing at the next time of rule processing. (See 9. Rule Processing)
1-2-2-1. If either player’s Leader takes damage when that player has 0 Life cards
remaining during the game, that player has met a defeat condition.
1-2-2-2. If either player has 0 cards in their deck during the game, that player has met
a defeat condition.
2
1-2-3. Either player may concede at any point during a game. When a player concedes,
they lose immediately and the game ends.
1-2-4. A concession is not affected by any card. Furthermore, concession cannot be
forced by any card effect, and defeat by concession cannot be replaced by any
replacement effect.
1-2-5. The effects of some cards may cause a player to win or lose the game. In such a
case, the player wins or loses during the processing of that effect, and the game
ends.
1-3. Fundamental Principles
1-3-1. When card text contradicts the Comprehensive Rules, the card text takes
precedence over the Comprehensive Rules.
1-3-2. If a player is required to perform an impossible action for any reason, that action
is not carried out. Likewise, if an effect requires the player to carry out multiple
actions, some of which are impossible, the player performs as many of the actions
as possible.
1-3-2-1. If an object is required to change to a given state, and the object is already in
that state, the object’s state remains the same, and the action is not performed.
1-3-2-2. If a player is required to perform an action 0 or a negative number of times
for any reason, that action is not carried out. A request to perform a certain
action negative times does not imply performing its opposite action.
1-3-3. If a card’s effect requires a player to carry out an action while a currently active
effect prohibits that action, the prohibiting effect always takes precedence.
1-3-4. If both players are required to make choices simultaneously for any reason, the
player whose turn it is makes the choices first. After that player has made their
choices, the other player makes their choices.
1-3-5. If a card or rule requires a player to choose a number, unless otherwise specified,
the player must choose a whole number of 0 or greater. Players cannot choose
numbers containing fractions less than 1, or negative numbers.
1-3-5-1. If a card or rule specifies a maximum value for a number, such as “up to ...”,
as long as no minimum number is specified, the player can choose 0.
1-3-6. If a card effect changes information on a card, unless otherwise specified or defined
by the rules, numbers on a card cannot contain fractions less than 1. If non-power
numbers would become negative, they are treated as 0, except in cases where the
information is added to or subtracted from.
1-3-6-1. Power can become a negative value.
1-3-6-1-1. Even if a card’s power becomes a negative value, unless otherwise
3
specified, that card will not be trashed or otherwise moved to another
area.
1-3-6-2. If the information regarding a cost is being changed by an effect, it may
become a negative value only for the duration of that calculation. Outside of
such calculations, the cost of a card whose value becomes negative is treated
as being 0.
1-3-6-2-1. If a card whose cost is already negative would have its cost further
increased or decreased by an effect, that negative value is included in
those calculations.
1-3-7. Unless otherwise specified, card effects are carried out in the order described on
the card.
1-3-8. If card effects require a player to rest a card and set it as active simultaneously, the
effect requiring the player to rest the card always takes precedence.
1-3-9. Cost and Activation Cost
1-3-9-1. Cost refers to a payment that must be made to play a card. A card’s cost is the
number written in its upper left corner. (See 6-5-3-1.)
1-3-9-2. Activation cost refers to a payment required to activate a card’s effect. (See 8-
3.)
1-3-10. If both players are instructed to perform some action at the same time according
to a card’s effect, the turn player is to perform the action first, followed by the
non-turn player.

6-5-6-2. For more information on battles, please refer to “7. Card Attacks and Battles”
below.
6-6. End Phase
6-6-1. This is the phase in which various end-of-turn processes are carried out.
6-6-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of Your
Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) are activated.
15
6-6-1-1-1. Auto effects that read “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) and “[End of
Your Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) can only be activated and resolved once.
6-6-1-1-2. After all “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects have been activated
and resolved, all “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword) effects are
activated and resolved.
6-6-1-1-3. If there are multiple “[End of Your Turn]” (Keyword) effects to be
resolved, the turn player may activate and resolve them in any order.
6-6-1-1-4. If there are multiple “[End of Your Opponent’s Turn]” (Keyword)
effects to be resolved, the non-turn player may activate and resolve them in
any order.
6-6-1-2. After all processing that is to be carried out at this time has been
completed, any remaining effects are processed in the following order:
(1) Process any continuous effects of the turn player that have been activated
and resolved, but are only due to be processed “at the end of this turn” or
“at the end of your turn”. The turn player’s effects that last “until the end
of the turn” and “until the end of the End Phase” become invalid. If there
are multiple such processes, the turn player may process them in any
order.
(2) Process any continuous effects of the non-turn player that have been
activated and resolved, but are only due to be processed “at the end of
this turn” or “at the end of your opponent’s turn”. The non-turn player’s
effects that last “until the end of the turn” and “until the end of the End
Phase” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the non-turn
player may process them in any order.
6-6-1-3. After all processing in 6-6-1-2 has been completed, the turn player’s effects
that last “during this turn” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the
turn player may process them in any order. Then, any of the non-turn player’s effects
that last “during this turn” become invalid. If there are multiple such processes, the
non-turn player may process them in any order.
6-6-1-4. The turn ends, the non-turn player becomes the new turn player, and the
game proceeds to the Refresh Phase of the next turn.
7. Card Attacks and Battles
7-1. During the Main Phase, the turn player can rest an active Leader card in their Leader
area, or an active Character card in their Character area, to attack an opponent’s Leader
card in their Leader area, or rested Character card in their Character area. When an
16
attack is made, the game proceeds to Battle (see 6-5-6.) and is processed in order from
the Attack Step (see 7-1-1.) to the Damage Step (see 7-1-4.).
7-1-1. Attack Step
7-1-1-1. Attacks are carried out by the Leader card, or a Character card in the
Character area. First, the turn player declares their attack by resting their
active Leader card or 1 active Character card.
7-1-1-2. The turn player then selects the target of their attack. The target can be either
the opponent’s Leader card or 1 of their rested Character cards in their
Character area.
7-1-1-3. Effects that read [When Attacking], “when you attack”, or [On Your
Opponent's Attack] activate.
7-1-1-4. If, at the end of the Attack Step, the attacking card or the target card for the
attack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Block Step
(see 7-1-2.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).
7-1-2. Block Step
7-1-2-1. The player being attacked can activate the [Blocker] effect of their card only
once during that battle.
7-1-2-2. When a [Blocker] is activated, effects that read [On Block] or “when you block”
activate.
7-1-2-3. If, at the end of the Block Step, the attacking card or the target card for the
attack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not the Counter Step
(see 7-1-3.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).
7-1-3. Counter Step
7-1-3-1. Effects of the player being attacked that read “when attacked” activate.
7-1-3-2. The player being attacked may perform the following actions in any order and
as many times as they wish:
7-1-3-2-1. Activate [(Symbol) Counter]: The player being attacked may trash a
Character card with [(Symbol) Counter] from their hand to activate an
effect that increases the power of their Leader or 1 Character card by the
value of the [(Symbol) Counter] during that battle.
7-1-3-2-2. Activate an Event card: The player being attacked may pay the cost of an
Event card with [Counter] in their hand, and then trash it to activate the
[Counter] effect.
7-1-2-3. If, at the end of the Counter Step, the attacking card or the target card for
the attack has moved areas due to some method, proceed not to the Damage
Step (see 7-1-4.), but to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).
17
7-1-4. Damage Step
7-1-4-1. Compare the power of the attacking card and the card being attacked. If the
power of the attacking card is greater than or equal to the power of the card
being attacked, the battle is won, and the result is either 7-1-4-1-1. or 7-1-4-
1-2., depending on the category of the card being attacked.
7-1-4-1-1. If a Leader card: 1 damage is dealt to that Leader.
7-1-4-1-1-1. If the opponent has 0 Life at the point when it is determined that
damage will be dealt, the attacking player wins the game.
7-1-4-1-1-2. If the opponent has 1 or more Life at the point when it is determined
that damage will be dealt, the opponent adds the card at the top of
their Life cards to their hand. At this time, if a card with [Trigger] is
added to the opponent’s hand from their Life area, the opponent may
choose to reveal the card and activate its [Trigger] instead of adding
it to their hand (see 10-1-5.).
7-1-4-1-1-3. If the damage taken is 2 or more due to an effect such as [Double
Attack], repeat 7-1-4-1-1-2. a number of times equal to the amount
of damage.
7-1-4-1-2. If a Character card: That Character card is K.O.’d (see 10-2-1.). Then,
proceed to End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).
7-1-4-2. If the power of the attacking card is less than the power of the card being
attacked, the attacking card will lose the battle, and nothing will happen during
that battle. Then, proceed to the End of the Battle (see 7-1-5.).
7-1-5. End of the Battle
7-1-5-1. The battle ends.
7-1-5-2. Your own and your opponent’s effects that read “at the end of the/this battle”
or “if this ... battles” activate.
7-1-5-3. The turn player’s effects that last “during this battle” become invalid.
7-1-5-4. The non-turn player’s effects that last “during this battle” become invalid.
7-1-5-5. The battle ends and the game returns to 6-5-2.
8. Activating and Resolving Effects
8-1. Effects
8-1-1. “Effect” refers to a command issued by the text of a card and its cost.
8-1-2. Effects may include words indicating choice, such as “can” and “may”. Where such
a word is included, players may choose not to activate the relevant effect. Where
no such word is included, the effect must always be activated and processed to the
18
extent possible.
8-1-3. Effects generally fall into one of four categories: “auto effects”, “activate effects”,
“permanent effects”, and “replacement effects”.
8-1-3-1. “Auto effects” always activate once automatically when the activation event
described in the text occurs during the game. If the same event occurs again,
the effect automatically activates again as many times as the event occurs,
unless otherwise specified.
8-1-3-1-1. Auto effects may be described in card text as [On Play], [When
Attacking], [On Block], [On K.O.], [End of Your Turn], and [End of Your
Opponent’s Turn]. In the case of other descriptions such as “when ...” and
“on ...”, these effects are still categorized as auto effects.
8-1-3-1-2. Some auto effects require an activation cost and/or the fulfillment of
conditions.
8-1-3-1-3. An auto effect will not activate and cannot be resolved even if the
activation timing is fulfilled if the card that fulfilled the activation timing of
that auto effect moves to another area before that effect is activated.
8-1-3-2. “Activate effects” can be declared and activated by the turn player during their
Main Phase (see 6-5-4.).
8-1-3-2-1. Activate effects may be described in card text as [Activate: Main] or
[Main].
8-1-3-2-2. Some activate effects require an activation cost and/or the fulfillment of
conditions.
8-1-3-3. “Permanent effects” constantly affect gameplay in some way while they are
valid.
8-1-3-3-1. Permanent effects may be those effects that, based on the card text,
cannot be classified as auto, activate, or replacement effects, but can be
classified as permanent effects.
8-1-3-3-2. Some permanent effects require the fulfillment of conditions for their
effect to be valid.
8-1-3-3-3. Some permanent effects read “according to/under the rules”. In this case,
the effect is valid and continues to affect gameplay even when the card is
in a secret area.
8-1-3-3-4. “Permanent effects” constantly affect gameplay in some way while they
are valid.
8-1-3-3-5. If a permanent effect changes its own impact on the game or that of
another permanent effect while it is being applied, due to that permanent
19
effect itself or another permanent effect, the following order is used to
process the changes, taking into account any continuous effects that have
already been resolved:
I. The turn player processes their permanent effects in any order.
II. The non-turn player processes their permanent effects in any order.
III. If steps I and II change the game's state further, repeat the process until no
further changes occur.
8-1-3-4. “Replacement effects” are those effects that are denoted by the word “instead”.
8-1-3-4-1. If a replacement is available but you choose not to apply the replacement,
the replacement effect will not be resolved.
8-1-3-4-2. If more than one replacement effect could apply to replace a situation,
the replacement effect of the card that generated that replacement effect
takes precedence, followed by the replacement effects of the turn player
in the order chosen by that player. Then, the non-turn player may apply
their replacement effects in the order they choose.
8-1-3-4-3. Once an individual process or situation has been replaced by any
sequence of replacements, the same replacement effects cannot be
applied to it again repeatedly.
8-1-3-4-4. A replacement effect applies to replace the entire part of the processing
of an effect indicated by the replacement effect, even if the processing of
that effect is still in progress.
8-1-3-4-4-1. If an effect is applied in order starting from the text closest to the top
and a replacement effect is applied in the middle of that text, the
remaining text is carried out in order after the replacement effect is
applied.
8-1-3-4-5. If it is not possible to carry out the replacement effect specified by
“instead”, that replacement effect cannot be applied.
8-1-3-4-6. If the conditions to activate another replacement effect are fulfilled as a
result of activating a replacement effect, that other replacement effect can
be activated.
8-1-3-4-7. The part of an effect where a replacement effect has been applied is
treated as an effect that was activated by the owner of that replacement
effect.
8-1-4. Effects can be one-shot effects or continuous effects.
8-1-4-1. One-shot effects refer to effects that affect the game at the moment they are
resolved and complete their processing immediately.
20
8-1-4-2. Continuous effects refer to effects that continue to affect the game for a
specified duration.
8-2. Valid and Invalid Effects
8-2-1. Some effects may render specific effects valid or invalid. In this case, process the
effect according to the rules below:
8-2-1-1. If it is specified that an effect is partially or totally invalid under specific
conditions, the invalid effect will not occur. If that effect requires a choice, the
choice will not be made. If that effect has an activation cost, that cost cannot
be paid.
8-2-1-2. If it is specified that an effect is partially or totally valid only under specific
conditions, that part is invalid if those conditions are not fulfilled.
8-2-2. Cards with invalid effects are not treated as cards with “no base effect”.
8-2-3. Auto effects or activate effects that have already been activated and resolved are
not invalidated by other effects.
8-2-4. If a card with an effect that has been invalidated gains a new effect, that effect is
not invalidated unless otherwise indicated.
8-3. Activation Cost and Conditions
8-3-1. An effect may specify that the action before the : colon must be taken. This is
referred to as the effect’s activation cost.
8-3-1-1. If there are multiple actions in one activation cost, they are to be carried out
in order starting from the text closest to the top.
8-3-1-2. Then, if activation costs are added by other effects, these are to be carried out
in the order for resolving those effects.
8-3-1-3. If it is not possible to pay some or all of the activation cost, the activation cost
to activate the effect cannot be paid at all.
8-3-1-3-1. If you have fulfilled the conditions to pay the activation cost, activated the
effect, and become unable to pay the activation cost while in the process
of paying the activation cost, pay as much of the activation cost as possible.
You cannot resolve the effect as written after the : colon. In addition, see
10-2-13-5. regarding the processing of [Once Per Turn] effects in this
situation.
8-3-1-4. Activation costs may be specified using “can” or “may”. The player can choose
not to pay the activation cost; however, this will mean the effect cannot be
activated.
8-3-1-5. Activation costs may be specified using a symbol such as ①. That symbol
means that the player must select a number of active DON!! cards equal to the
21
number in the symbol from their cost area and rest them.
8-3-1-6. Activation costs may be specified using a symbol such as “DON!! －X”. This
means that the player must select a total number of DON!! cards equal to the
value of X from their Leader area, Character area, and cost area, and return
them to their DON!! deck.
8-3-1-7. Where an activation cost is replaced according to an effect, it is possible to
carry out the replacement processing instead of paying the activation cost. If
the activation cost is not paid as described in the text, the effect following the :
colon will not be processed.
8-3-1-8. Effect text may include text such as “when...”. This is referred to as the
activation timing of that effect. Some keywords also have activation timing.
8-3-2. Effect text may include text such as [DON!! xX], [Your Turn], and [Opponent’s
Turn]. This is referred to as the effect’s condition.
8-3-2-1. If there are multiple conditions in one effect, all of the conditions must be
fulfilled.
8-3-2-2. If other conditions are added by another effect, all of those conditions must
also be fulfilled.
8-3-2-3. Conditions may be specified using [DON!! xX]. This condition is met when
the number of DON!! cards given to this card is equal to or greater than the
value of X.
8-3-2-4. Conditions may be specified using [Your Turn]. This condition is met during
your turn.
8-3-2-5. Conditions may be specified using [Opponent’s Turn]. This condition is met
during your opponent’s turn.
8-3-3. Effect text may include “if...”. So long as that clause is not fulfilled, effects after
the “if” clause will not be resolved.
8.4. Activation and Resolution
8-4-1. To activate an effect, follow the procedure below:
8-4-1-1. If there are conditions for activation, those conditions must be met. The effect
cannot be activated if the conditions are not met.
8-4-1-2. Specify the effect to be activated. If it is an effect of a card in your hand, reveal
that card.
8-4-1-3. If there are activation costs required to activate that effect, determine the
activation costs and pay all activation costs.
8-4-1-4. Activate the effect.
8-4-1-5. Resolve the effect.
22
8-4-2. When activating the effect of an Event card, trash that Event card and carry out
the specified effect.
8-4-3. When the effect of a card in the Leader area, Character area, or Stage area is
activated, carry out that effect.
8-4-4. When “choose”, “select”, “up to” or another phrase indicating choice is included
in the effect, the indicated cards, players, or other items are to be chosen when
required to do so during the resolution of the skill.
8-4-4-1. When the number to be chosen is specified, the player must choose as many
cards, players, or other items as they can, up to the number specified.
However, if “up to” is specified, the player may also choose 0.
8-4-4-2. When the items to be chosen are unrevealed cards in a secret area, and the
choice requires information from the card, players cannot guarantee that the
chosen card meets the required conditions. Thus, a player can decide not to
choose a card from a secret area, even if it may fulfill the conditions.
8-4-4-3. When there are no specific instructions in the text for choosing a card, player,
or other item, if the effect applies to a card, it indicates the card from which
the effect originates. If the effect applies to a player, it indicates the player of
that effect.
8-4-4-4. When choosing cards from the deck, check the cards’ faces and choose the
specified cards.
8-4-5. Auto effects that activate when a card is moved from one area to another will only
activate if the area the card is moved to is an open area. For example, this applies
to cards with an [On K.O.] effect.
8-4-6. When an effect is activated, it is activated and resolved taking into account any
continuous effects that were resolved before it, as well as any valid permanent
effects.
8-5. Card Activation and Effect Activation
8-5-1. Card activation and effect activation are different.
8-5-2. Card activation refers to using an Event card from your hand.
8-5-3. Effect activation refers to activating the effect of a card.
8-5-4. For example, when a card reads “when you activate an Event”, it is referring to
card activation.
8-6. Order of Effect Resolution
8-6-1. When the activation timing of card effects of both the turn player and non-turn
player is fulfilled at the same time, the turn player will resolve their effect first. If,
in so doing, the activation timing of another card effect of the turn player is
23
fulfilled, the non-turn player will first resolve their card effect for which the
activation timing has been fulfilled. After that, the turn player will resolve their
card effect.
8-6-1-1. If the activation timing of effects A and B of the turn player are fulfilled at
the same time, and effect A is resolved first, thereby fulfilling the activation
timing of effect C, effect C can be resolved following the resolution of effect
B.
8-6-2. If the activation timing of an effect is fulfilled during damage processing, the effect
can be activated after all damage processing has been resolved.
8-6-2-1. If a Life card that is checked during damage processing has [Trigger], you
can temporarily suspend the damaging processing, reveal the card with
[Trigger] and activate that [Trigger] effect instead of adding it to your
hand.
8.6.3. If the activation timing of an effect is fulfilled by activating a card or activating
an effect, the effect can be activated after the resolution of the effect of the
previously activated card.
9. Rule Processing
9-1. Fundamental Rule Processing
9-1-1. Rule processing refers to processing that is automatically carried out according to
the rules when specific events have occurred or are occurring during the game.
9-1-2. Rule processing is immediately resolved when the corresponding event occurs,
even if other actions are in the process of being carried out.
9-2. Defeat Judgment Processing
9-2-1. At the point when rule processing begins, if any player fulfills any of the defeat
conditions below, all of those players lose the game.
9-2-1-1. If either player’s Leader takes damage when that player has 0 Life cards, that
player has fulfilled the defeat conditions for the game.
9-2-1-2. If either player has 0 cards in their deck, that player has fulfilled the defeat
conditions for the game.

10-2-13-1. [Once Per Turn] is a keyword indicating an effect can only be activated
and resolved once during that turn.
10-2-13-2. Where there are multiple cards with the same effect, [Once Per Turn]
effects can be activated and resolved once for each card.
10-2-13-3. After a [Once Per Turn] effect has been resolved once, it cannot be
activated again, even if the conditions can be met during that turn. In
addition, that card’s activation cost cannot be paid again during that turn.
10-2-13-4. If a card is moved to another area after its [Once Per Turn] effect has been
resolved once, if the card once again appears on the field, the [Once Per
Turn] effect can be activated again because it is treated as a different card.
(See 3-1-6.)
10-2-13-5. If a [Once Per Turn] effect is activated and you become unable to pay the
activation cost while in the process of paying that activation cost, you may
not activate the [Once Per Turn] effect again even if the effect following
that activation cost did not resolve as result (see 8-3-1-3.).
10-2-14. Trash
10-2-14-1. “Trash” is a keyword indicating that a card is to be selected from the hand
and placed in the trash.
10-2-15. [On Block]
10-2-15-1. [On Block] is a keyword indicating that the activation timing is fulfilled and
an effect activates during the Block Step when you have activated your
[Blocker] (see 7-1-2-2.).
10-2-16. [On Your Opponent’s Attack]
10-2-16-1. [On Your Opponent’s Attack] is a keyword indicating that the activation
timing is fulfilled when your opponent has declared an attack during their
Attack Step (see 7-1-1.), and an effect activates after your opponent’s
[When Attacking] and other Attack Step effects, if any, have been activated
27
(see 7-1-1-3.).
10-2-17. [On K.O.]
10-2-17-1. [On K.O.] is a keyword indicating that when the card is K.O.’d on the field,
the activation timing is fulfilled and you should check whether the
activation conditions have been met. If all the conditions have been met,
the effect is activated on the field. After that, the Character card with the
activated [On K.O.] effect is trashed, and the [On K.O.] effect is resolved
while the card is in the trash.
10-2-17-2. [On K.O.] is different from other auto effects because the Character card
moves areas between the effect is activated and resolved.
11. Other
11-1. Infinite Loops
11-1-1. When carrying out some processing, there may be occasions where an action can
be or must be carried out infinitely. This is called an infinite loop, and one cycle
of action from the start to the end of the loop is called a loop action. If such an
event occurs, follow the procedure below.
11-1-1-1. If neither player can stop an infinite loop, the game ends in a draw.
11-1-1-2. If only one player has the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop
action, that player declares how many times they wish to carry out the loop
action. Carry out the loop action that many times and finish it at a timing
when that player can choose to stop the infinite loop. The player cannot
choose to restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all
cards in all areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to
do so.
11-1-1-3. If both players have the choice to stop the infinite loop during the loop action,
the turn player first decides how many times they wish to carry out the loop
action. Next, the non-turn player decides how many times they wish to carry
out the loop action. Carry out the loop action the fewer of these two times
and finish it at a timing when the player who chose the fewer of these two
times can choose to stop the infinite loop. The players cannot choose to
restart the loop even if the game is in exactly the same state (all cards in all
areas are the same) as before the loop unless they are forced to do so.
11-2. Revealing Cards
11-2-1. When a card is required to be moved from one secret area to another secret area,
such as “Add Monkey.D.Luffy from your deck to your hand”, the card being
28
moved must always be revealed, even if there are no instructions to reveal it.
11-2-2. When a card in a secret area is revealed by a card’s effect or cost, the card is set
as unrevealed after that card’s effect or cost is resolved.
11-3. Viewing Secret Areas
11-3-1. Some effects enable players to look at secret areas. Unless otherwise specified by
the card, such effects apply only to the player of that effect.
11-3-2. Cards remain in their original areas while being looked at.
11-3-3. After looking at cards in secret areas, if there is nothing in the card text regarding
actions to be taken in reference to the cards that were looked at, those cards must
be returned to their original area in their original state.
