# Preserve Candidates

This file lists any code from the old engine implementation that should be
preserved or referenced during the rewrite.

---

## Status: No items preserved

The old engine and engine-adapter directories were removed without preserving
any code. The new engine skeleton has been created from scratch with detailed
implementation guidance.

If any old code patterns should be referenced, add them here with notes on
why they're valuable.

## Format for preserved items:

```
### [Component Name]
**Source:** old path
**Reason:** why preserved
**Code:**
(paste relevant code)
**Notes:** implementation guidance
```
